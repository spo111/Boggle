# Boggle
Boggle is a word game with a board made up of 16 cubic dices. Each dice has a letter printed on each of its sides. When the game starts,
the 16 dices are shaken and randomly distributed in a 4-by-4 tray, with only one side visible. The players compete to accumulate points
by building valid words.

A detailed description of the rule can be found in the link below:
http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/boggle.html

The program automatically finds all valid words in a given Boggle board, using a given dictionary and outputs the scores.

Run BoggleSolver to start the game. In this folder, a list of dictionary and boards are provided for testing.

The first argument takes the name of the dictionary and the second argument takes the name of the board file.
